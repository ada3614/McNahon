                    Rights Act 1998.</h1>
                <p class="content-txt">Paragraph 276ADE.
                    The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on the
                    grounds of private life in the UK are that at the date of application, the applicant:
                    In order to meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) to 276ADE(1)(vi), the decision maker
                    must be satisfied that an applicant meets one of the following requirements:
                    (iii) has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years (discounting any period of
                    imprisonment); or
                    (iv)is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in the UK for at least 7 years
                    (discounting any period of imprisonment) and it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to
                    leave the UK; or
                    (V) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent at least half of his life living
                    continuously in the UK (discounting any period of imprisonment); or
                    (vi) subject to paragraph 276ADE(2), is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in the UK for
                    less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but there would be very significant
                    obstacles to the applicant’s integration into the country to which he would have to go if required
                    to leave the UK. Paragraph 276ADE(2) sets out that paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) does not apply, and may
                    not be relied upon, in circumstances in which it is proposed to return a person to a third country
                    pursuant to Schedule 3 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004.

                    Children under 18 years old who has been resident in the UK for at least 7 years
                    Paragraph 276 ADE (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in the UK for at
                    least 7 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) and it would not be reasonable to expect the
                    applicant to leave the UK;
                    Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 requires the Home Office in the
                    execution of their duties to take into consideration the need to safeguard and promote the welfare
                    of children in the UK. It does not impose any new functions, or override existing functions.
                    The UK Border Agency instruction ‘Arrangements to Safeguard and Promote Children’s Welfare in the
                    United Kingdom Border Agency’ sets out the key principles to take into account in all Agency
                    activities. The statutory duty to children includes the need to demonstrate: <br><br>
                    • Fair treatment which meets the same standard a British child would receive; <br>
                    • The child’s interests being made a primary, although not the only consideration; <br>
                    • No discrimination of any kind; <br>
                    • Asylum applications are dealt with in a timely fashion; <br>
                    • Identification of those that might be at risk from harm</p>
